Hello! 

To run our blockchain implementation please install libraries: 
  cryptokit, sqlite3, raylib, and raygui

to do so run the following lines individual within the command line:
  opam install cryptokit 
  opam install sqlite3
  opam install raylib 
 

Once they're installed, make sure you're in the root directory. Now, compile the code with dune build: 
  dune build 

Great, now you will be able to open menu. 
To do so, make sure you are in the root directory "cs-3110-project-main"
Now run the following line: 
  dune exec bin/menu.exe
